Description: Simplifies remote connections to computers behind NAT firewalls
 weavedconnectd allows you to connect remotely to any tcp-based service running
 on your Linux or Mac OS/X computer. All that is a required is installation of 
 a small daemon and configuration files. By using Weaved's cloud services, port 
 forwarding can be completely eliminated.  Weaved supplies iOS and Android 
 applications as well as convenient access from any browser even without Weaved 
 installed.
